# Indian Sign Language Translator (ISL Connect)

## Overview
Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translator, also known as **ISL Connect**, is a machine learning-powered tool designed to translate Indian Sign Language gestures into text and speech. This project aims to bridge the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities in India by providing an interactive and accessible solution.

## Features
- Real-time Gesture Recognition: Uses computer vision and deep learning to detect and interpret sign language gestures.
- Camera Integration: Allows users to input sign language through their webcam or external camera.
- User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for easy interaction.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Languages: Python
- Frameworks & Libraries:
  - OpenCV (for image processing)
  - TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning models)
  - Mediapipe (for hand tracking and gesture recognition)`

## Usage
1. Run the Program
2. Allow camera access when prompted.
3. Start signing in front of the camera.
4. The system will detect and translate the gestures in real time.
5. The recognized text will be displayed.

## Future Enhancements
- Improved accuracy with more training data.
-Multilanguage translation option.
- Support for complex gestures and full sentence translation.
- Mobile app integration.
- Offline mode for accessibility in remote areas.
